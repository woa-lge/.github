## Repositories

We host several repositories for providing resources for the LgeWOA project, as well as several open source projects of various components.

Key projects include:

- UEFI ports (Most of the hard work being graciously done by the [WOA-Project](https://github.com/WOA-Project) and [Renegade Project](https://github.com/edk2-porting) orgs.)
- Driver Packages (Again, most of the hard work being graciously done by the [WOA-Project](https://github.com/WOA-Project) orgs)
